What is the meaning of CHKRES Warning? ,DV is being increased from 3.000000 to 15.000000 CM-1. The output step size cannot be smaller than the band model resolution,"CHKRES warnings are generated when spectral response functions do not drop to zero at their endpoints. MODTRAN models the responses as zero outside the spectral range, generating the warning.  Also, super refractive conditions, where the line of sight turns downward, can cause a CHKRES warning, but only for non-vertical paths. It is important to note that warnings generally do not indicate faulty calculations. (Pages 38, 46)",0.82513857
